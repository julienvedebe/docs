title: 'Retrieve latest odo readings'
description: 'Automatically collect live odometer data across your fleet for leasing, finance or compliance reporting.'
---

### Overview

Instead of manually checking each vehicle’s mileage on site, use the myConnectedFleet API to retrieve **up-to-date odometer readings** for all vehicles in your account.  
This data can be shared directly with your **leasing provider**, **finance department**, or **fleet management system**, saving time and improving accuracy.

The `/vehicle` and `/livePosition/latest` endpoints return the latest distance and odometer values recorded by each connected asset.

### Benefits
- ✅ Save time: No more manual yard checks — retrieve all mileage readings in one call.
- ✅ Improve accuracy: Values are sourced directly from the vehicle’s on-board telematics.
- ✅ Automate reporting: Share JSON or CSV exports with leasing or finance systems.
- ✅ Support compliance: Maintain verifiable, timestamped odometer logs for audits.


### How It Works

Query your vehicle list and include the latest telemetry data such as odometer and total distance.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/vehicle \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```
  
Each response includes the following useful fields:

- registration: Vehicle registration or plate number
- name: Friendly name or identifier
- odometerKm: Latest odometer reading (km)
- lastUpdated: Timestamp of the last recorded odometer value


>💡 **Tip**: Use consistent vehicle names and registration numbers that match your leasing provider’s records. This ensures that exported mileage data aligns automatically with your external systems and avoids manual reconciliation.
