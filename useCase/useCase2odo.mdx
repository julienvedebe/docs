### Overview
Instead of manually checking each vehicle’s mileage on site, use the myConnectedFleet API to retrieve **up-to-date odometer readings** for all vehicles in your account.  
This data can be shared directly with your **leasing provider**, **finance department**, or **fleet management system**, saving time and improving accuracy.

The `/vehicle` and `/livePosition/latest` endpoints return the latest distance and odometer values recorded by each connected asset.

### Benefits
- Save time: No more manual yard checks — retrieve all mileage readings in one call.
- Improve accuracy: Values are sourced directly from the vehicle’s on-board telematics.
- Automate reporting: Share JSON or CSV exports with leasing or finance systems.
- Support compliance: Maintain verifiable, timestamped odometer logs for audits.


### How It Works
Query your vehicle list and include the latest telemetry data such as odometer and total distance.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/vehicle \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```
  
Each response includes the following useful fields:
- Registration: Vehicle registration or plate number
- Name: Friendly name or identifier
- OdometerKm: Latest odometer reading (km)
- LastUpdated: Timestamp of the last recorded odometer value


<Tip> Use consistent vehicle names and registration numbers that match your leasing provider’s records. This ensures that exported mileage data aligns automatically with your external systems and avoids manual reconciliation.</Tip>


Example Output
```
{
  "items": [
    {
      "registration": "YH18 ABC",
      "name": "Truck 12",
      "vin": "WDF1234567890",
      "odometerKm": 128432,
      "lastUpdated": "2025-10-29T16:22:45Z"
    },
    {
      "registration": "DY20 LNX",
      "name": "Trailer 07",
      "vin": "1HTMKADN8LH123456",
      "odometerKm": 89420,
      "lastUpdated": "2025-10-29T15:54:33Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note> 
Remember that CANbus odometer type readings come directly from the vehicle’s onboard sensors, while readings with odometer type GPS are estimated based on distance travelled from a known starting point. For the most accurate mileage reporting, use CANbus where available, and treat GPS odometers as approximate values.
