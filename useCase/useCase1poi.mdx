### Overview
By creating and categorising your key address locations using the /location and /location/category endpoints, every journey, stop, and visit in your fleet reports will automatically include meaningful location names and context — rather than just address (or coordinates).


### How It Works
Create location categories to group your address types
Use /location/category to define logical groupings such as "Customer", "Depot", "Supplier", or "Warehouse".

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/location/category \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Customer",
  "icon": "circle-blue"
}'
```

<Tip> 
Use clear, descriptive names for your locations and categories, for example, “Leeds Depot” or “Tesco Milton Keynes.” Consistent names make your data easier to understand in reports.  Avoid vague codes or abbreviations, and keep your address book up to date as sites open, close, or change purpose.
</Tip>


### Add your customer or depot locations
Use /location to add or update points of interest.
Each location can be defined by coordinates or a full postal address and linked to one of your categories.


```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/location \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Leeds Depot",
  "categoryName": "Customer",
  "address": {
    "road": "Priory Park",
    "city": "Leeds",
    "postCode": "LS25 3DF",
    "country": "England"
  },
  "radius": 1,
  "contact": "John Smith",
  "email": "john.smith@mycompany.com",
  "notes": "Open 8am until 6pm"
}'
```

### Link your business data
When your vehicles visit these locations, myConnectedFleet automatically tags journeys and stops using your defined names — e.g. Stopped at “Customer A”, returned to "Leeds Depot”.
