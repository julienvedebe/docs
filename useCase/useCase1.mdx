## Overview

Enrich your tracking and journey data by synchronising your own list of customers, depots, and delivery sites with the myConnectedFleet platform.

By creating and categorising your key address locations using the /location and /location/category endpoints, every journey, stop, and visit in your fleet reports will automatically include meaningful location names and context — rather than just coordinates.


**How It Works**

Create location categories to group your address types
Use /location/category to define logical groupings such as "Customer", "Depot", "Supplier", or "Warehouse".

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/location/category \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Customer",
  "icon": "circle-blue"
}'
```


**Add your customer or depot locations**
Use /location to add or update points of interest.
Each location can be defined by coordinates or a full postal address and linked to one of your categories.

POST /customer/{customerId}/location
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Leeds Depot",
  "categoryName": "Depot",
  "address": {
    "road": "Priory Park",
    "city": "Leeds",
    "postCode": "LS25 3DF",
    "country": "England"
  },
  "radius": 0.001,
  "contact": "John Smith",
  "email": "john.smith@mycompany.com"
}


Link your business data
When your vehicles visit these locations, myConnectedFleet automatically tags journeys and stops using your defined names — e.g. Stopped at “Customer A”, returned to "Leeds Depot”.
