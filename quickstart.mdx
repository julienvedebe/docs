**MICHELIN Connected Fleet** APIs allow you to integrate your fleet into virtually any platform, They cover all the features in my Connected Fleet, from tracking, driver behaviour, vehicle management through to user management.

To make a call, you need an API **username**, **password** and your **customer accout number**.  Please speak to your account manager if you do not have these details.

The API uses **Basic** HTTP authentication. Include your username and password encoded in base64 in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request, with your **customer accout identifier** included in the URL.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/tracking/live \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>'
```

The API returns JSON-encoded responses:
