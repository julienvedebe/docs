**MICHELIN Connected Fleet** APIs allow you to integrate telematics data from your fleet into virtually any platform. They cover all the features in **MICHELIN Connected Fleet**, from tracking, driver behaviour, vehicle management through to user management.

To make a call to the API, you need a **username**, **password** and your **customer accout number**.  Please speak to your account manager if you do not have these details.

The API uses **Basic** HTTP authentication. Include your username and password encoded in base64 in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request, with your **customer accout identifier** included in the URL.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/tracking/live \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>'
```

The API response is JSON-encoded:
