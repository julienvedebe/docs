### To make an API call
<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Get your credentials">
    You’ll need a **username**, **password**, and your **customer account number**.  
    If you don’t have these details, please ask your **Account Manager**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Authenticate your request">
    The MCF API uses **Basic HTTP Authentication**.  Encode your username and password in **Base64**, and include them in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request:
    ```bash
    Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Include your account identifier">
    Add your **customer account number** to the request URL.  
    This tells the API which account context to retrieve or modify data for.
  </Step>
 <Step title="4. Now make your first call!">
    Use this curl to request the latest poisition of your fleet.  

  ```bash
  curl --request GET \
    --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/tracking/live \
    --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>'
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Voila!">
    You made your first call.  
    The API response is JSON-encoded, see an example below; 

    ```json
    [
      {
        "assetRegistration": "TYOX-42-AK",
        "assetName": "TYOX-42-AK",
        "assetId": "2068071",
