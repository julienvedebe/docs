The response for a GET request can be paginated. This means for each request, the response will be one page of results.

To work with paginated endpoints, include `pageIndex`and `padeSize` in the request header

**pageIndex** - specifies the pagination page index. Pages are zero indexed, i.e. the first page has an index value of zero. If not specified, then will default to a pageIndex of 0.

**pageSize** - specifies the number of items to include on a page. Must be specified if pageIndex has been specified. If not specified, then will default to a pageSize of 50.

Example

pageIndex=2&pageSize=3

If not specified, then will default to a pageIndex of 0.


**Compression**
The API suppprts compress.

Include the following in the **HTTP header** if your application can accept HTTP responses that have been compressed using GZIP.

Accept-Encoding:     gzip
