The response for a GET request can be paginated. This means for each request, the response will be for one page of results.

To work with paginated endpoints, include `pageIndex`and `pageSize` in the request header. If values are not specified, then default values will be used.

- **pageIndex**
  - Specifies the pagination page index. Pages are zero indexed, i.e. the first page has an index value of zero. If not specified, then will default to a pageIndex of 0.
- **pageSize**
  - Specifies the number of items to include on a page. Must be specified if **pageIndex** has been specified. If not specified, then will default to a pageSize of 50.

An API endpoint supporting pagination, will include `totalPages`and `totalCount` in the output response. These should be used to determine how many subsequent requests will need to be made.

- **totalPages**
  - Total number of pages based on the pageSize.
- **totalCount**
  - Total number of items that matched the search parameters

For example, the following response indicates that in total 4 requests have to be made to the API to get all the items (based on the default value of `pageSize` ).

```json
{
    "totalPages": 4,
    "totalCount": 164,
    "items": [
        {
         ...
        }
    ],
    "processedDateTime": "2025-10-03T13:56:46.393"
}
```

## Latest endpoints

A common integration use case is to show changes that have occured recently, for example, which journeys have completed since 11:00, which vehicles have changed location etc.

To assist with this type of integration, the following endpoints accept the optional parameter: `fromDateTime`

- **Live Position Latest**
- **Live Position Latest AEMP**
- **Live Position Latest GeoJSON**
- **Vehicle Journeys Latest**
- **Driver Journeys Latest**
- **Vehicle Journey History Latest**
- **Driver Journey History Latest**

You can use these endpoints to return items that have been processed by MICHLEIN Connected Fleet since a specified date/time as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Call the endpoint">
    Do not specify a value for`fromDateTime`

    - The output response will include `processedDateTime`

    ```json
    {
        ...,
        "processedDateTime": "2025-10-03T13:56:46.393"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='On the next call specify the "fromDateTime"'>
    Set the value for`fromDateTime`to be the same as the value for `processedDateTime`from the previous call.

    - The response for this request, will include only those items that have been processed by MyConnectedFleet platform since the specified date/time.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url 'https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/25078/tracking/live/latest?fromDateTime=2025-10-03T14%3A31%3A56' \
      --header 'Authorization: Basic #####'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compression

The API suppprts compress.

Include the following in the **HTTP header** if your application can accept HTTP responses that have been compressed using GZIP.

```
Accept-Encoding:     gzip
```
