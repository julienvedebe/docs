### Pagination
The response for a GET request can be paginated. This means for each request, the response will be for one page of results.

To work with paginated endpoints, include `pageIndex`and `pageSize` in the request header. If values are not specified, then default values will be used.

**pageIndex**
- Specifies the pagination page index. Pages are zero indexed, i.e. the first page has an index value of zero. If not specified, then will default to a pageIndex of 0.

**pageSize**
- Specifies the number of items to include on a page. Must be specified if

**pageIndex** 
- has been specified. If not specified, then will default to a pageSize of 50.


An API endpoint supporting pagination, will include `totalPages`and `totalCount` in the output response. These should be used to determine how many subsequent requests will need to be made.

**totalPages**
- Total number of pages based on the pageSize.
  
**totalCount**
- Total number of items that matched the search parameters

For example, the following response indicates that in total 4 requests have to be made to the API to get all the items (based on the default value of `pageSize` ).

```json
{
    "totalPages": 4,
    "totalCount": 164,
    "items": [
        {
         ...
        }
    ],
    "processedDateTime": "2025-10-03T13:56:46.393"
}
```

### Compression

The API suppprts compress.

Include the following in the **HTTP header** if your application can accept HTTP responses that have been compressed using GZIP.

```
Accept-Encoding:     gzip
```
