## Latest endpoints

A common integration use case is to show changes that have occured recently, for example, which journeys have completed since 11:00, which vehicles have changed location etc.

To assist with this type of integration, the following endpoints accept the optional parameter: `fromDateTime`

- **Live Position Latest**
- **Live Position Latest AEMP**
- **Live Position Latest GeoJSON**
- **Vehicle Journeys Latest**
- **Driver Journeys Latest**
- **Vehicle Journey History Latest**
- **Driver Journey History Latest**

You can use these endpoints to return items that have been processed by MICHLEIN Connected Fleet since a specified date/time as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Call the endpoint">
    Do not specify a value for`fromDateTime`

    - The output response will include `processedDateTime`

    ```json
    {
        ...,
        "processedDateTime": "2025-10-03T13:56:46.393"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='On the next call specify the "fromDateTime"'>
    Set the value for`fromDateTime`to be the same as the value for `processedDateTime`from the previous call.

    - The response for this request, will include only those items that have been processed by MyConnectedFleet platform since the specified date/time.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url 'https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/25078/tracking/live/latest?fromDateTime=2025-10-03T14%3A31%3A56' \
      --header 'Authorization: Basic #####'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
