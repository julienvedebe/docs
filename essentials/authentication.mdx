To make a call to the API, you need an API **username**, **password** and your **customer accout number**.  Please speak to your account manager if you do not have these details.

You can access the **MICHELIN Connected Fleet API** through HTTP requests to URLs like:

```
https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/
```

The API uses **Basic** HTTP authentication. Include your username and password encoded in base64 in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP request, with your **customer accout identifier** included in the URL.

- With the **username **and **password **being included in the HTTP header, it is recommended to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/{customerId}/tracking/live \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <encoded-value>'
```
