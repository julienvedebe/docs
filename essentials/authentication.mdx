The **MICHELIN Connected Fleet APIs** endpoints are accessed using the HTTP 1.1 transport protocol, as defined by IETF RFC-2616.  

HTTP Basic Authentication is used, therefore the HTTP **Authorization** header field must be populated with the username and password of a MICHELIN Connected Fleet API user encoded using Base64. With the username and password being included in the HTTP header, it is recommended to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

You can read more about HTTP Basic Authentication and how to encode a username/password using Base64 at [<u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) .

You can read more about the HTTP Header at [<u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_header</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_header) .  

Please speak to your **Customer Service Representative** if you do not have a Connect Partner username/password or you cannot access the required **MICHELIN Connected Fleet API** endpoint.
