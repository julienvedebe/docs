## 2. MCF Solution

The MCF Connect solution comprises of:


- Connect – this is the component that receives and processes the tracking events from an On
Board Unit (OBU).


- Connect Web Application - this is the web based application used for managing
assets/resources and accessing the track and trace functionality of Connect.


- OBU – is the tracking box installed on the resource and connects via GPRS to Connect. The
OBU transmits vehicle events such as ignition on, ignition off, resource movement and
resource position to Connect.

- Connect API - this is the Application Programming Interface that allows data to be pulled
from Connect.

### 2.1 Target Audience

Connect is used to track and trace a resource. **Connect** receives location and related data from
the asset via an **OBU**. The tracking data is viewable using the **Connect Web Application** in either
tabular or on a map.

A resource can be:

- Vehicle – An asset (car, van, truck, trailer, boat, power generator etc.) which has an OBU
installed.

  - A vehicle can be assigned to a group. The group assigned to a vehicle does not have
to be the same group as assigned to a driver.

  - If a vehicle is part of the customer’s fleet (having a status of IN-CIRCULATION), its
position is included in the response from Live Position.

  - If a vehicle is no longer part of the customer’s fleet (having a status of SOLD), the
vehicle is not included in the response from Live Position but details of historical
journeys can be retrieved

- Driver – A person that drives a vehicle. A driver can be associated with a key fob which
enables Connect to determine who is driving a vehicle. A driver can be associated with a
vehicle, e.g. their company car. A driver can be assigned to a group. The group for the driver
does not have to be the same group as assigned to the vehicle.

### 2.2 Group

**Connect** allows for the creation of a group hierarchy. You have only one group hierarchy, but
you can create many subgroups within the hierarchy to meet your reporting/tracking
requirements.


A resource (vehicle or driver) can be assigned to only one group in the hierarchy. You do not
need to assign a driver to the same group as their default vehicle.

For example, the following company, country, city and fleet group hierarchy can be used to
group drivers and vehicles. Drivers would be assigned to any of the subgroups under “Offices”,
whilst vehicles would be assigned to any of the subgroups under “Fleet”.

```
Masternaut
Offices
United Kingdom
Leeds
Skipton
France
Suresnes
Germany
Munich
Fleet
Car
HGV
```
By assigning a vehicle/driver to a group enables tracking information to be retrieved for either:


- A single vehicle

- A single driver.

- All vehicles based on type (e.e. car).

- All drivers based in one city (e.g. Leeds).

- All drivers based in one country (e.g. United Kingdom).

- All vehicles or drivers in the company (e.g. Masternaut)

### 2.3 Tracking and Tracing

**Tracking** is knowing the location of a resource in real time. In addition to the location, Connect
captures speed, direction of travel and other information items depending on the vehicle type
(e.g. gritting events).

**Tracing** is knowing the locations where a resource has been. Historic location information is
stored by Connect based on the customer’s data retention period. This period is configurable,
please speak to your **Customer Service Representative** for details.


### 2.4 Journey

A journey is a vehicle moving between locations. The start of the journey is when the ignition is
switched on and the end of the journey is when the ignition is switched off. There can be many
journeys for a vehicle on the same day. By associating a driver with a vehicle or if the driver has a
key fob, allows you to track and trace the journeys for a driver.

During the journey the vehicle’s status will change, for example:

```
● driving - The vehicle is moving. Movement events are generated every minute or when
certain events occur, e.g. harsh braking, harsh accelerating.
```
```
● idling - The vehicle has not moved location but the ignition is still on.
```
```
● endOfJourney - The vehicle’s ignition has been switched off.
```
A private journey is a journey that a driver has specified as **private**. A **private journey** cannot be
tracked or traced using the **Connect Web Application**. Likewise, the **Connect API** does not
return any tracking or tracing information for a private journey. However, the distance travelled
and the fuel used in a private journey are taken into account when calculating utilisation and fuel
summary details.

### 2.5 Distance Travelled

The distance that a vehicle travelled during a journey is captured by the OBU using one of two
methods:

```
Method Definition
```
```
CAN This is the most accurate method with the OBU extracting the distance
travelled from the vehicle’s CANbus.
```
```
You can read more about CANbus at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus
```
```
GPS During a journey, the OBU calculates the distance between each GPS
location and sums these distance values together to derive the total
distance for the journey.
```
```
This method is not as accurate as the distance obtained from the
CANbus.
```

### 2.6 Point Of Interest (POI)

```
A Point of Interest (POI) is a map location that has been given a name and marked by a geo-fence
boundary. By creating POI locations, it is possible to report when a resource has arrived at or
departed from that named location. There is a limit on the number of locations you can create.
```
```
● Using the Connect Web Application you can create a location and specify the geo-fence
boundary to be either a circle or a polygon.
```
```
● Using the Connect API , the geo-fence boundary can be defined as a circle or a polygon.
```
```
When creating a POI location, it is assigned a location category. You can create as many
location categories as required to meet your reporting/tracking requirements. The location
category can be assigned one of the standard Connect icons. The icon is displayed on the map
when using the Connect Web Application to view a journey.
```
```
This is a list of the icon names that can be used:
```
**Name Icon Name Icon Name Icon Name Icon**

airport customer depots fuel station (^)
local_usine location_hotel office port (^)
prospect restaurant restaurants service_red (^)
supplier train_station
building company gazStation home (^)
hotel house internal location (^)
man none others usine (^)
circle-blue circle-green circle-orange circle-purple (^)
circle-red circle-white circle-yellow
dot-blue dot-green dot-navy dot-orange (^)
dot-red dot-yellow
flag-blue flag-green flag-orange flag-purple (^)
flag-red flag-white flag-yellow
pin-orange pin-green pin-purple pin-red (^)
pin-white pin-yellow


### 2.7 Tags

A tag is a word that you can use to add information about a driver or vehicle. For example, you
can add a tag to identify if the driver is an engineer, has a particular skill, or if the vehicle has a
long wheelbase etc.

Tags can be used in addition to the **Connect** features of groups and vehicle types. There is no
limit on the number of tags you can create.

### 2.8 Driver Keys

A **driver key** is a way to identify who is driving a vehicle. A driver signs in with their key before
they begin a journey.

A driver can sign in using either:

```
● TachoID – the driver signs in using their Tachograph smart card.
```
```
● RFID – the driver touches their key fob against the MCF Light Bar.
```
```
● DALLAS – the driver touches their Dallas key fob against the MCF Light Bar.
```
A key can be configured so that all journeys using that key are specified as private journeys. A
private journey cannot be tracked or traced using the **Connect Web Application**.

A driver key (TachoID, RFID or DALLAS) can only be assigned to a single driver. Before you can
assign the key to another driver, the key must be first deleted from the donor driver.

### 2.9 Driver Behaviour

**Driver behaviour** provides an analysis of the driving behaviour based on the three key
performance indicators (KPI) which are based on the driving events that occur during a journey.
Driver behaviour analysis requires the driver to be either the default driver for a vehicle or the
driver signed in with their driver key during the journey.

The three key performance indicators (KPI) are:

```
● Smoother
```
```
○ This KPI shows how smoothly a vehicle was driven. It decreases when the driver
brakes or accelerates harshly.
```
```
● Safe Speed
```
```
○ This KPI shows how the percentage of distance travelled at safe speed. It decreases
when the driver exceeds the road speed limit by more than 10%.
```
```
● Cleaner
```

```
○ This KPI shows the percentage of time spent driving compared to drive time + idling
time. It decreases when more time is spent idling.
```
```
The aim for a driver is to achieve a value of 100% for each KPI.
```
```
● Changes in KPI values where the trend shows an increase in KPI value shows an
improvement in driving behaviour.
```
```
● Changes in KPI values where the trend shows a decrease in KPI value shows a deterioration
in driving behaviour.
```
```
Due to the methodology used to calculate these KPI, the KPI can be used to compare the driving
style across drivers in different groups, and organisations.
```
```
Note:
```
```
● Although either Driver Behaviour or EcoDrive can be used to analyse the driver’s driving
behaviour, MCF’s preferred methodology is to use Driver Behaviour.
```
### 2.10 EcoDrive

```
The EcoDrive product allows analysis of a driver’s driving behaviour based on driving events that
occur during a journey. EcoDrive analysis can be performed either for a vehicle or driver. Driver
analysis requires the driver to be either the default driver for a vehicle or the driver signed in
with their driver key during the journey.
```
```
The events that can be analysed are:
```
```
● Harsh braking
```
```
● Harsh acceleration
```
```
● Harsh cornering
```
```
● Over revving
```
```
● Excessive idling
```
```
● Speed over a defined threshold
```
```
Excessive idling can occur either inside or outside a specified set of POI location categories. For
example, if you set the location category for a number of POI locations to be “Goods Drop Point”,
you can then analyse the number of excessive idling that occurred within and outside these
“Goods Drop Point” POI locations.
```
```
Speed over a defined threshold event is generated whenever the vehicle’s speed exceeds the
value set for the ecoDrive speed threshold. The ecoDrive speed threshold is not checked
against the road speed limit and is not the same as a speeding episode.
```
```
The EcoDrive scoring algorithm uses these events to calculate a score per hour for a vehicle and
a driver. The target is to have a score of zero, i.e. there were no “bad” driving events during a
```

```
period being analysed. The calculated score can be used to rank the driving behaviour within a
group and compare the driving behaviour with all the other vehicles/drivers in the same group.
```
```
The EcoDrive scoring algorithm can be configured to give greater weight to one driving event
over the other events, for example, you can initially give greater weight to speeding, but as driver
behaviour changes, you can give greater weight to idling.
```
```
Please speak to your Customer Service Representative to find out more details about your
EcoDrive settings.
```
```
Note:
```
```
● Although either Driver Behaviour or EcoDrive can be used to analyse the driver’s driving
behaviour, MCF’s preferred methodology is to use Driver Behaviour.
```
### 2.11 Inputs and PTO

```
As well as detecting if the vehicle is moving, stopped or idling, the Masternaut OBU can be
configured to detect other vehicle activity, for example:
```
```
● if a door is opened or closed;
```
```
● the beacon lights are switched on or switched off;
```
```
● the street sweeper brushes are down or up.
```
```
This vehicle activity is reported in Connect Web Application as an input.
```
```
Power Take Off ( PTO ) is when the vehicle engine is being used to power additional machinery,
for example a crane. PTO uses additional fuel, therefore, it is important to know if the PTO was
active when the vehicle was moving, active when the vehicle was idling or if the PTO was inactive
and the vehicle was idling.
```
### 2.12 Advanced Inputs (Input Events)

```
The OBU can be configured to interface to a physical input. To remove the need to physically
interface to the OBU and to expand the type of inputs that can be supported by Connect , a set
of advanced input event endpoints have been created that allow input event data to be sent to
the Connect Application using the Advanced Inputs API.
```
```
An input event consists of:
```
```
● Asset identifier – the asset that the input event was generated against.
```
```
● Location – the latitude and longitude values where the input event occurred.
```
```
● Event type – that describes the overall event.
```
```
● Channel - that describes data for the event consisting of a number of input type key/value
pairs.
```

```
These are some example event and input types:
```
```
Event Type Input types
```
```
Vehicle Metrics Engine temperature
```
```
Tyre pressure
```
```
Oil Level
```
```
Refuse collection Bin Weight
```
```
Bin RFID tag
```
```
Photograph
```
```
Gully Cleaning Customer name
```
```
Work order
```
```
Time taken
```
```
Event Types and Input Types are loosely coupled. So, it is possible to use the “Oil Level” input for
both the “Vehicle Metrics” and “Gully Cleaning” events.
```
```
Input events added using the Advanced Inputs API are
```
```
● Shown in the Connect Web Application.
```
```
● Included in the response of Live Position and Live Position Latest.
```
### 2.13 Tax & Expense

```
The Tax & Expense product allows drivers to classify their journeys as business or private for tax
and business expense purposes. Once a journey has been classified it can be submitted to the
driver’s manager for approval.
```
```
The classifications for a journey are as follows:
```
```
● NOTSUBMITTED – the journey has not yet been submitted by the driver.
```
```
● BUSINESS – the journey was a business journey.
```
```
● PERSONAL – the journey was a personal journey.
```
```
● COMMUTE_A – a journey that was a commute to a normal place of work, this classification is
required in some European countries.
```
```
● COMMUTE_B – a journey that was a commute to a temporary place of work, this
classification is required in some European countries.
```

### 2.14 Connect Web User

```
A Connect web user has login credentials to access the Connect Web Application. The Connect
Web Application features that a user can access is dependent on the role they are assigned.
```
```
You can define the features that are available for each role and can create as many roles as
required to meet your reporting needs. A Connect Web user can be assigned to only one role.
```
```
A Connect Web user is allocated to a group in the group hierarchy. A user can only view details
(drivers, vehicles, journeys) for resources in the same group (or one of its subgroups) in the
group hierarchy.
```
```
When creating or updating a user, you can specify the timezone and language for the user with
the following values:
```
```
Attribute Definition
```
```
Timezone The timezone for the user. Dates and time are held in UTC and
converted into the specified timezone when displaying details in the
Connect Web Application.
```
```
Allowed timezone values are:
● Australia/Sydney
● Australia/Brisbane
● Australia/Adelaide
● Australia/Darwin
● Australia/Perth
● Atlantic/Azores
● Europe/Prague
● Europe/Berlin
● Europe/Copenhagen
● Europe/London
● Europe/Helsinki
● Europe/Paris
● Europe/Athens
● Europe/Rome
● Europe/Amsterdam
● Europe/Warsaw
● Europe/Lisbon
● Europe/Madrid
● Europe/Stockholm
● Africa/Luanda
● Africa/Casablanca
● Africa/Maputo
● America/New_York
● America/Chicago
● America/Denver
● America/Los_Angeles
● America/Anchorage
```

```
● America/Halifax
● America/Cayenne
● America/Guadeloupe
● America/Martinique
● Pacific/Honolulu
● Pacific/Midway
● Pacific/Noumea
● Pacific/Auckland
● Indian/Mayotte
● Indian/Reunion
```
Language The **Connect Web Application** provides multilingual support for the
following languages:
● English, English (US), French, Spanish, Swedish, German,
Czech, Danish, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Greek, Finnish and
Portuguese.

```
The language for the user is specified as one of the following
locales:
```
```
locale Language
```
```
en_GB English
```
```
en_US American English
```
```
fr_FR French
```
```
es_ES Spanish
```
```
sv_SE Swedish
```
```
de_DE German
```
```
cs_CZ Czech
```
```
da_DK Danish
```
```
nl_NL Dutch
```
```
pl_PL Polish
```
```
it_IT Italian
```
```
el_GR Greek
```
```
fi_FI Finnish
```
```
pt_PT Portuguese
```
Unit of
measures

```
When a user is added to the Connect Web Application using the
Connect API , the unit of measures to use when viewing fuel
```

```
consumption, speed, fuel and distance are configured based on the
settings for the user’s customer account.
```
```
A user can update their settings using Connect Web Application.
```
```
You cannot specify the password for a Connect Web User in the same request as creating a new
Connect web user or when updating the details for an existing user. Instead, you set the
password by using the Set User Password endpoint and using either the token returned in the
JSON response from adding a new web user or the token returned in the JSON response from
calling the Password Reset Token endpoint.
```
```
This approach has been done as it allows you to either:
```
```
● Use the Set User Password endpoint to set the password.
```
```
● Send an email to the user so the user can use the Connect Web Application to set the
password.
```
```
The URL to include in the email to allow the user to use the Connect Web Application set
should be formatted as follows:
```
```
https://www.masternautconnect.com/Account/LogOn?customer=&token={token}#reset-passwor
d
```
```
Where {token} is the token returned in the JSON response from Add User or Password Reset
Token endpoints.
```
### 2.15 Single Sign On

```
The Connect Web Application supports Single Sign On (SSO) using the OpenID Connect
standard. SSO avoids the Connect Web User having to remember another username/password
combination as the user can access the Connect Web Application using their company’s
authentication details.
```
```
To enable SSO for a web user, you set an external identifier against the user.
```
```
● The external identifier is used to associate a user in your Authorization Server to a Connect
web user.
```
```
● The external identifier is returned by your Authorization Server once the user has been
successfully authenticated by your Authorization Server.
```
```
● A Connect Web User enabled for SSO cannot use the Connect Web Application functionality
to reset their password.
```
```
You can read more about OpenID Connect at https://openid.net/connect/.
```

### 2.16 Speeding Episodes

```
The Connect application is able to determine if a vehicle is speeding and will create a speeding
episode whenever both of the following conditions are satisfied.
```
```
● The vehicle speed exceeds the road speed limit for the vehicle type.
```
```
● At least two consecutive tracking frames are received where the vehicle speed exceeded the
road speed limit for the vehicle type.
```
```
A speeding episode ends when any one of the following occurs:
```
```
● The vehicle’s speed drops below the road speed limit for the vehicle type.
```
```
● The speed limit for the road cannot be determined.
```
```
● The road type changes.
```
```
The road speed limit for a vehicle depends on the vehicle type. The following are UK examples of
the road speed limits for different vehicle types.
```
```
Vehicle Type Single
carriageways
```
```
Dual
carriageways
```
```
Motorways
```
```
Cars, motorcycles,
car-derived vans and
dual-purpose vehicles.
```
```
60 mph (96 km/h) 70 mph (
km/h)
```
```
70 mph (
km/h)
```
```
Goods vehicles (not more
than 7.5 tonnes maximum
laden weight).
```
```
50 mph (96 km/h) 60 mph (
km/h)
```
```
70 mph (
km/h)
```
```
It is important that the vehicle type is set correctly as this will ensure the correct road speed limit
is used.
```
### 2.17 Alerts

```
The Connect application can trigger an alert when specific conditions are met. Alerts can be set
for a single vehicle or vehicles in a group.
```

The available alert types are:

```
Alert Type Description
```
```
