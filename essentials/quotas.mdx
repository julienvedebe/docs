## Quota limits

There is a quota limit on the number of POI that you can create:

- 250,000 if the number of vehicles in your fleet is less than 1,000. 
- Based on 250,000,000/number of vehicles, if the number of vehicles in your fleet is over 1,000; e.g. for a fleet with 2,000 vehicles the maximum number of POI is restricted to 125,000.

## Request limits

The following request limits are in place:

- No more than one request for the **Live Position** endpoint every 15 seconds.
- No more than one request for the **Live Position Latest** endpoint every 15 seconds.
- No more than one request for the **Live Position AEMP **endpoint every 15 seconds.
- No more than one request for the **Live Position Latest AEMP **endpoint every 15 seconds.
- No more than one request for the **Vehicle Journeys Latest** endpoint every 60 seconds.
- No more than one request for the **Driver Journeys Latest** endpoint every 60 seconds.

## Asset Day Limits

An **Asset Day** is calculated based on the (number of vehicles \* the number of days in period) specified in the input parameters. For example,

- **1 asset day** = requesting 1 day of data for one vehicle
- **50 asset days** = requesting 50 days of data for one vehicle 
- **50 asset days** = requesting 1 day of data for 50 vehicles

(note that asset = driver rather than vehicle when calling a Driver-centric endpoint)

The following Asset Day Limits are in place:

- No request that exceeds 1000 asset days for **Vehicle Journeys**.
- No request that exceeds 1000 asset days for **Driver Journeys**.
- No request that exceeds 50 asset days for **Vehicle Detail Business Travel**
- No request that exceeds 50 asset days for **Driver Detail Business Travel**
- No request that exceeds 50 asset days for **Vehicle Speeding Detail**.
- No request that exceeds 100 asset days for **Driver Speeding Detail**.
- No request that exceeds 50 asset days for **Vehicle Idling Detail**.
- No request that exceeds 50 asset days for **Driver Idling Detail**.

Additional quota limits, restrictions and changes to quota limits may be implemented in future releases of the **Connect API**.
