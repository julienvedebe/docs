title: "REST endpoints"
description: "The MICHELIN Connected Fleet API has been implemented using RESTful principles. All requests are made to specific URI endpoints. Data to an endpoint and the response from an endpoint are formatted in JSON. "

---

JSON data types, such as String, Number and Boolean are used where applicable. If there is no data to return, an empty JSON list is returned. Additionally, empty data is omitted in the result – i.e. there are no "null" values. 

If you are new to REST and JSON, you can read the 

- basics of REST at: [<u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST)   
- basics of JSON at [<u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) 

The structure of the URI endpoint is as follows:

/v1/customer/**{customerId}**/

**{customerId}** is your Connect customer number and must be included in the URL.

Please speak to your **Customer Service Representative** if you do know your customer number. This is an example of the URI for the List Group endpoint, with the **{customerId}** set to be 123456: 

[<u>https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/123456/group</u>](https://api.masternautconnect.com/connect-webservices/services/public/v1/customer/123456/group)

This is an example of the JSON output after calling the List Group --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

As the **MICHELIN Connected Fleet** has been implemented using RESTful principles, the following HTTP request methods are used: 

| **HTTP Request Method** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET                     | Used for the retrieval of data items from an endpoint.                                                                                                                                                         |
| POST                    | Used in the following circumstances:  - Request creation of a new data item. - Request data from an endpoint to overcome the 8K limit on the length of the request line and header fields sent to an endpoint. |
| PUT                     | Used to create a new data item or to update the details for an existing data item.                                                                                                                             |
| DELETE                  | Used to delete an item.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

NOTE: For POST/PUT/DELETE requests, ensure you have set the **content-type** of the HTTP request body to "**application/json;charset=UTF-8**". 

You can read more about the different HTTP requests methods (including GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) at [<u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUT\_(HTTP)#Request_methods</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUT_\(HTTP\)#Request_methods). 

All requests to the **MICHELIN Connected Fleet** receive an HTTP response code to confirm if the request was successful or not. The following HTTP codes can be returned:

| **HTTP response code** | **Definition**                                 | **When returned**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200                    | Standard response for successful HTTP requests | When the request has been successfully completed.  <br />This response is returned for a GET, POST and PUT.  Also returned even if an empty set is returned.                                                                                                    |

| 406                    | Not Acceptable                                 | The output from the endpoint is not acceptable to the calling client (as defined by the Accept headers included in the request).                                                                                                                                |

| 500                    | Internal server error                          | There has been an internal error within the **API**.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

If there has been an error, the following JSON object is returned:



The **errorMsg** element includes details of the error and what corrective action to take; for example, if an incorrect icon name has been specified, then the errorMsg includes a list of all the valid icon names. 

The **MICHELIN Connected Fleet** has an 8K limit on the length of the request line and header fields sent to an endpoint. If the 8K limit is exceeded, then the request will be rejected and no error code will be returned.
