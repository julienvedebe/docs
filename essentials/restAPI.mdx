Explore the key information you’ll need to get started with the **MICHELIN Connected Fleet APIs**.

These APIs enable seamless integration of vehicle, driver, and journey data into your own systems — helping you build connected, data-driven fleet solutions.

For a deeper understanding of how our platform works, see [Solution Concepts](/solution/overview).

### Telematics

You can get the latest GPS location of a vehicle, vehicle information (input values, fuel consumption, vehicle faults) and synchronize this data into your own applications.

**MICHELIN Connected Fleet** has a number of telematics devices which can be installed on a vehicle. As each device has different interface features, the device will determine the telematics functionality you will see in **MICHELIN Connected Fleet** and data that can be retrieved from the API.

GPS tracking provides the location, speed and direction of travel for a vehicle in real time. By combining individual tracking data, we can generate journeys for a vehicle. By linking a driver to a vehicle, driver behaviour metrics can be calculated.

### Vehicles

Vehicles details can be managed through the API. The following details can be set for a vehicle:

- Name
- Group
- Tags
- vehicle type
- status - if the vehicle is active in the fleet.

See [Vehicles](/solution/vehicles) for more details.

<Note>
  Vehicles cannot be created or deleted using the API. A vehicle can be set as "SOLD" to indicate that the vehicle is no longer active in the fleet.
</Note>

### Drivers

Drivers can be created and managed through the API. The folliowig details can be set for a driver:

- Name
- Group
- Tags
- Default vehicle
- Driver keys (RFID, TachoID) to indicate which vehicle is being driven by this driver.

Full create, read, and update operations are available through the API. See [Drivers](/solution/drivers) for more details.

<Note>
  Drivers are not deleted, instead the **delete** request will update the driver status **inactive**.
</Note>

### Groups

The group hierarchy allows you to organise your vehicles, drivers & users to meet your reporting needs.

```
Offices
	United Kingdom
		London
	France
		Paris
	Germany
		Munich
Fleet
	Car
	HGV
```

Full create, read, and update operations are available through the API. See [Groups](/solution/group) for more details.

### Locations / Points of interest (POI)

You can manage known locations for use in driver timesheets, reports, alerts and more. You can create, read, update, and delete locations and configure their geofences.

Full create, read, delete and update operations are available through the API. See [Locations ](/solution/locations)for more details.

### Users

The features of the **myConnectedFleet portal** that a user can access are dependent on their assigned role. You can define the features available for a role and can create as many roles as needed.

A user is allocated to a group in the group hierarchy. A user can only view details for drivers, vehicles, journeys in the same group (or one of its subgroups) in the group hierarchy

Full create, read, delete and update operations are available through the API. See [Users ](/solution/users)for more details.
