## Telematics

You can get GPS and vehicle data to create integrations that synchronize this telematics data into your application. Get the latest GPS location of a vehicle, input status values, fuel consumption along with vehicle faults.

MICHELIN Connected Fleet has a number of telematics devices which can be installed on a vehicle. As each device has different interface features, the device will determine the telematics functionality you will see in MICHELIN Connected Fleet and data that can be retrieved from the API.

GPS tracking provide the location, sped and direction of travel for a vehicle in real time. By combining individual tracking data, we can generate the journeys for a vehicle.

By linking to a driver of a vehicle, driver behaviour metrics can be calculated.

## Vehicles

Vehicles details can be managed through the API. The following details can be set for a vehicle:

- Name
- Group
- Tags
- vehicle type
- status - if the vehicle is active in the fleet.

See [Vehicles](/solution/vehicles) for more details.

<Note>
  Vehicles cannot be deleted using the API. They can only set as "SOLD" to indicate that the vehicle is no longer active in the fleet.
</Note>

## Drivers

Drivers can be created and managed through the API. The folliowig details can be set for a driver:

- Name
- Group
- Tags
- Default vehicle
- Driver keys (RFID, TachoID) to indicate which vehicle is being driven by this driver.

Full create, read, and update operations are available through the API. See [Drivers](/solution/drivers) for more details.

<Note>
  Drivers cannot be deleted using the API. The **\_delete \_**operation will set the driver as inactive.
</Note>

## Group

A group hierarchy allows you to organise your vehicles, drivers & users to meet your reporting needs.

```
Offices
	United Kingdom
		Leeds
		Skipton
	France
		Suresnes
	Germany
		Munich
Fleet
	Car
	HGV
```

Full create, read, and update operations are available through the API. See [Group ](/solution/group)for more details.

## Locations / Points of interest (POI)

The Location API allows you to manage known locations for use in driver timesheets, reports, alerts and more. You can create, read, update, and delete locations and configure their geofences.

Full create, read, delete and update operations are available through the API. See the [Locations ](/solution/locations)API for more details.

## Users

The MICHELIN Connected Fleet features that a user can access is dependent on their assigned role. You can define the features available for a role and can create as many roles as needed.

A user is allocated to a group in the group hierarchy. A user can only view details (drivers, vehicles, journeys) in the same group (or one of its subgroups) in the group hierarchy

Full create, read, delete and update operations are available through the API. See the [Users ](/solution/users)API for more details.

or you can pull ad-hoc reports. See the Telematics guide for an overview of available query patterns and diagnostics.

## Inputs and PTO

As well as detecting if the vehicle is moving, stopped or idling, the telematics device can be configured to detect other vehicle activity, for example:

- if a door is open or closed
- if beacon lights are switched on or switched off
- temperature of the cold chamber
- tyre pressue and temperature

**Power Take Off (PTO)** is when the vehicle's engine is being used to power additional machinery, for example a crane to unload goods from the vehicle. **PTO** uses additional fuel, therefore, it is important to know if the PTO was active when the vehicle was idling.
