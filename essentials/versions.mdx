The **API** version is shown in the URL for an endpoint e.g.

```
https://api.masternautconnect.com/connectwebservices/services/public/v1/   
```

Improvements to the API can result in the addition of new endpoints or the addition of new elements in the output JSON structure. These changes are backward compatible and therefore, they will not will not result in a new version of the **API**.  

With JSON, the order of elements in the output data structure is not guaranteed. The ordering of elements in the JSON object may change following an update to the **API**.

Only, If elements are removed, will a new version of the **API** will be released.
