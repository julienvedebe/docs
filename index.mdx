## Welcome

**MICHELIN Connected Fleet APIs** give you secure, real-time access to your fleet data — vehicles, drivers, journeys, events, and checks — so you can integrate telematics insights directly into your own systems, workflows, and applications.

Whether you need live location updates, vehicle health, driver behaviour analytics, or compliance data, our APIs are designed to help you build faster, smarter fleet solutions.
