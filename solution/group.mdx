description: "Connect allows for the creation of a group hierarchy."
---

You have only one group hierarchy, but you can create many subgroups within the hierarchy to meet your reporting/tracking requirements.

A resource (vehicle or driver) can be assigned to only one group in the hierarchy. You do not need to assign a driver to the same group as their default vehicle.

For example, the following company, country, city and fleet group hierarchy can be used to group drivers and vehicles. Drivers would be assigned to any of the subgroups under “Offices”, whilst vehicles would be assigned to any of the subgroups under “Fleet”.

| Masternaut        Offices          United Kingdom               Leeds              Skipton          France               Suresnes          Germany               Munich      Fleet          Car          HGV |

By assigning a vehicle/driver to a group enables tracking information to be retrieved for either:

- A single vehicle
- A single driver.
- All vehicles based on type (e.e. car).
- All drivers based in one city (e.g. Leeds).
- All drivers based in one country (e.g. United Kingdom).
- All vehicles or drivers in the company (e.g. Masternaut)
