The address for the location can be specified as either:

- **longitude** and **latitude** coordinates 

An address lookup is done to determine values for **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode** and **country**. The **formattedAddress** is constructed as a comma separated set of values from **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode** and **country**.

- **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode**, **country** 

A lookup is done to determine the **longitude** and **latitude** coordinates for specified details. The **formattedAddress** is constructed as a comma separated set of values from **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode **and **country**. 

If value for both address and longitude/latitude values are specified, then no check is performed to validate that the address matches the longitude/latitude values.
