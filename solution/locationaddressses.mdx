title: 'Location addresses'
---

The address for the location can be specified as either:

- **longitude **and **latitude **coordinates 

An address lookup is done to determine values for **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode** and **country**. The **formattedAddress** is constructed as a comma separated set of values from **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode** and **country**.

- **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode**, **country** 

Values for **city**, **postcode** and **country** are mandatory and must be included in the input JSON object. The **formattedAddress** is constructed as a comma separated set of values from **roadNumber**, **road**, **city**, **postcode **and **country**. A lookup is done to determine the **longitude** and **latitude **coordinates.

If both an address and longitude/latitude values are specified, then no check is performed to validate that the address matches the longitude/latitude values.
