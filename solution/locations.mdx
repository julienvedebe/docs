A Location is, also known as a Point of Interest (POI) is Geofence, a geogrpahic location that has been given a name and marked by a geo-fence boundary. By creating POI locations, it is possible to report when a resource has arrived at or departed from that named area (location).  

These can be created using the myConnectedFleet Web Application or API you can create a location and specify the geo-fence boundary to be either a circle or a polygon.


The geofence for a location can overlap the geofence for another location. The geofence for this location can overlap up to 5 locations.

There cannot be an existing location with the same name as the location being created.


### Limits
There is a limit on the number of locations you can create.  The maximum number of POI that can be created in your account is limited based on the number of vehicles in your fleet. 
- If your fleet size is less than 1,000 then you can create up to 250,000 locations. 
- If your fleet size is more than 1,000, then the maximum is reduced on a sliding scale depending on the number of vehicles in your fleet.
