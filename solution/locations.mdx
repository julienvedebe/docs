By creating POI locations, it is possible to report when a resource has arrived at or departed from that named location. There is a limit on the number of locations you can create.

- Using the **Connect Web Application** you can create a location and specify the geo-fence boundary to be either a circle or a polygon. 
- Using the **Connect API**, the geo-fence boundary can be defined as a circle or a polygon. 

When creating a POI location, it is assigned a **location category**. You can create as many location categories as required to meet your reporting/tracking requirements.  The location category can be assigned one of the standard Connect icons. The icon is displayed on the map when using the Connect Web Application to view a journey. 

This is a list of the icon names that can be used:
