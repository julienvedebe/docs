title: "Locations"

A Location, also known as a Point of Interest (POI) or Geofence, is a defined geographic area that has been given a meaningful name and boundary. Locations are used to identify when a vehicle or asset enters or leaves a specific area — such as a customer site, depot, or delivery point.

You can create and manage Locations using either the **myConnectedFleet** portal or the API.

When creating a Location, you can define its geofence boundary as either a circle or a polygon, depending on the shape and accuracy you need.


<Tip> Use clear and consistent naming for your Locations (e.g., “Leeds Depot”, “Customer – Tesco York”) to make journey and visit reports easier to interpret.</Tip>

### Additional Rules

- A Location’s geofence may overlap with other Locations — up to a maximum of five overlapping areas.
- Each Location must have a unique name; duplicate names are not allowed.

### Limits

The number of Locations that can be created in your account depends on fleet size.
- Fleets with fewer than 1,000 vehicles: You can create up to 250,000 Locations.
- Fleets with more than 1,000 vehicles: The maximum number of Locations is reduced on a sliding scale based on the total number of vehicles in your fleet.
  
<Note>
These limits ensure optimal performance when processing geofence and visit data across large fleets. If you require higher limits, please contact your Michelin Connected Fleet representative.
