### Radius

- The radius for the circle must be between 0.001 and 1.


### Polygon
- The geofence for the location is a polygon which is specified as an array of longitude and latitude pairs.
- You must specify at least three  **longitude** and **latitude** pairs.
- The geofence boundary is closed automatically by linking the first **longitude** and **latitude** pair to the last **longitude** and **latitude** pair specified.
