A **myConnectedFleet** web user has login credentials to access the **myConnectedFleet Web Application**. 

The **features** that a user can access is dependent on the **role** they are assigned. 
- A web user can be assigned to only one role. 
- You can define the features that are available for each role and can create as many roles as required to meet your reporting needs. 


A web user is allocated to a **group**. This grants access to view specfic resources of a company.  
- A user can only view details (drivers, vehicles, journeys) for resources in the same group (or one of its subgroups) in the group hierarchy.
