A **myConnectedFleet** user has login credentials to access the **myConnectedFleet portal**.

The **features** that a user can access is dependent on the **role** they are assigned. 

- You can only assign one role to a user. 
- You can define the features that are available for each role and can create as many roles as required to meet your reporting needs.

A user is allocated to a **group**. 

- A user can only view details (drivers, vehicles, journeys) for resources in the same group (or one of its subgroups) in the group hierarchy.
