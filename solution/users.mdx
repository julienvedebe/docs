A **myConnectedFleet** web user has login credentials to access the **myConnectedFleet Web Application**. 

The features that a user can access is dependent on the **role** they are assigned. 

You can define the features that are available for each role and can create as many roles as required to meet your reporting needs. A Connect Web user can be assigned to only one role. 

A Connect Web user is allocated to a group in the group hierarchy. A user can only view details (drivers, vehicles, journeys) for resources in the same group (or one of its subgroups) in the group hierarchy.
