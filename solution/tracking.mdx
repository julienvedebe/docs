**Tracking** is knowing the location of a resource in real time. In addition to the location, Connect captures speed, direction of travel and other information items depending on the vehicle type (e.g. gritting events). 

**Tracing** is knowing the locations where a resource has been. Historic location information is stored by Connect based on the customer’s data retention period. This period is configurable, please speak to your **Customer Service Representative** for details.
