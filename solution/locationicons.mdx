When creating a POI location, it is assigned a location category. You can create as many location categories as required to meet your reporting/tracking requirements. The location category can be assigned one of the standard Connect icons. The icon is displayed on the map when using the my Connected Fleet Web Application to view a journey.


This is a list of the icon names that can be used:
