When creating a Location (Point of Interest or POI), it must be assigned to a Location Category.  You can create as many categories as needed to match your organisation’s reporting or tracking requirements, for example, Customer Sites, Depots, or Delivery Points.

Each **Location Category** can be assigned one of the standard myConnectedFleet icons.
These icons are displayed on the map within the myConnectedFleet portal to help visually distinguish different types of locations.

**Available Icons**
Below is a list of the standard myConnectedFleet icon names that can be used when creating or updating a Location Category via the API.

<Tip>
  Choose icons that make your maps easier to interpret, for example, use colour-coded icons to represent customers, depots, or restricted areas.
