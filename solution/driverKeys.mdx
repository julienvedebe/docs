A **driver key** is a way to identify who is driving a vehicle. A driver signs in with their key before they begin a journey. 

A driver can sign in using either:

- **TachoID** – the driver signs in using their Tachograph smart card.
- **RFID** – the driver touches their key fob against the MCF Light Bar.
- **DALLAS** – the driver touches their Dallas key fob against the MCF Light Bar.

A key can be configured so that all journeys using that key are specified as private journeys. A private journey cannot be tracked or traced using the **Connect Web Application**. 

A driver key (TachoID, RFID or DALLAS) can only be assigned to a single driver. Before you can assign the key to another driver, the key must be first deleted from the donor driver.
