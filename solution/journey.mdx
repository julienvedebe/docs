**A Journey**
A journey occurs when a a resource (a vehicle or driver) moves between locations. 
- The start of the journey typically starts when the ignition is switched on, and ends when the is switched off.  However for some vehicles e.g trailers, this can be between start and stopped moving.  

- There can be many journeys for a vehicle on the same day.

- By associating a driver with a vehicle either a permeant assciation, or if the driver has a key fob, journeys can also be viewed by driver.


During the journey the vehicle’s status can change, for example:

- **driving** - The vehicle is moving. Movement events are generated every minute or when certain events occur, e.g. harsh braking, harsh accelerating.
- **idling** - The vehicle has not moved location but the ignition is still on.
- **endOfJourney** - The vehicle’s ignition has been switched off.
