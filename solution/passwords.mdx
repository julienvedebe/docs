You cannot specify the password for a **myConnectedFleet** portal user in the same request as creating a new portal user or when updating the details for an existing user.

Instead, you set the password by using the **Set User Password** endpoint, using either the token returned in the JSON response from adding a new user or the token returned in the JSON response from calling the **Password Reset Token** endpoint. 

This approach has been implemented as it allows you to either:

- Use the **Set User Password** endpoint to set a password.
- Send an email to the user so they can use the **myConnectedFleet portal** to set their own password.

The URL to include in the email to allow the user to use the **myConnectedFleet portal** should be formatted as follows:

```
https://www.masternautconnect.com/Account/LogOn?customer=&token=#reset-password
```

Where is the **token** returned in the JSON response from **Add User** or **Password Reset Token** endpoints.
