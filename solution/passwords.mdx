You cannot specify the password for a myConnectedFleet web User in the same request as creating a new  web user or when updating the details for an existing user. Instead, you set the password by using the **Set User Password** endpoint and using either the token returned in the JSON response from adding a new web user or the token returned in the JSON response from calling the **Password Reset Token** endpoint. 

This approach has been done as it allows you to either:

- Use the **Set User Password** endpoint to set the password.
- 
- Send an email to the user so the user can use the **myConnectedFleet Application** to set the password.

The URL to include in the email to allow the user to use the **myConnectedFleet Web Application** set should be formatted as follows:

[<u>https://www.masternautconnect.com/Account/LogOn?customer=&token={token}#reset-password</u>](https://www.masternautconnect.com/Account/LogOn?customer=&token={token}#reset-password) 

Where **{token}** is the token returned in the JSON response from **Add User** or **Password Reset Token** endpoints.
