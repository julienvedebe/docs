A tag can be used to add information about a driver or vehicle (skills and attributes). For example, you can add a tag to identify if the driver is an engineer, has a particular skill, or if the vehicle has a long wheelbase etc.

Tags can be used in addition to the **myConnectedFleet** features of groups and vehicle types. 

There is no limit on the number of tags you can create.
