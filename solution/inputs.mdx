As well as detecting if the vehicle is moving, stopped or idling, some OBUs can be configured to detect other vehicle activity, for example:

- if a door is opened or closed; 
- the beacon lights are switched on or switched off; 
- the street sweeper brushes are down or up. 

This vehicle activity is reported in **myConnectedFleet portal **as an **input**, as both durations and geographic locations of occurance.

**PTOs** 

Power Take Off (PTO) is where a vehicles engine is being used to power additional machinery, for example a crane. As a PTO uses additional fuel, customers often want to identify this, know how much fuel was used and to see if a vehicle was moving or idling with PTO is enaged.

A PTO usage can be recorded in **myConnectedFleet** as a specfic type of input.
