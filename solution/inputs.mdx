As well as detecting if the vehicle is moving, stopped or idling, some OBUs can be configured to detect other vehicle activity, for example:

-  if a door is opened or closed; 
- the beacon lights are switched on or switched off; 
- the street sweeper brushes are down or up. 

This vehicle activity is reported in Connect Web Application as an input.

**Power Take Off** (**PTO**) is when the vehicle engine is being used to power additional machinery, for example a crane.  **PTO** uses additional fuel, therefore, it is important to know if the PTO was active when the vehicle was moving, active when the vehicle was idling or if the PTO was inactive and the vehicle was idling. 


An input event consists of:

- **Asset identifier** – the asset that the input event was generated against.
- **Location** – the latitude and longitude values where the input event occurred.
- **Event type** – that describes the overall event.
- **Channel** - that describes data for the event consisting of a number of input type key/value pairs.

These are some example event and input types:

```
### 2.11 Inputs and PTO

```
As well as detecting if the vehicle is moving, stopped or idling, the Masternaut OBU can be
configured to detect other vehicle activity, for example:
```
```
● if a door is opened or closed;
```
```
● the beacon lights are switched on or switched off;
```
```
● the street sweeper brushes are down or up.
```
```
This vehicle activity is reported in Connect Web Application as an input.

Power Take Off ( PTO ) is when the vehicle engine is being used to power additional machinery,
for example a crane. PTO uses additional fuel, therefore, it is important to know if the PTO was
active when the vehicle was moving, active when the vehicle was idling or if the PTO was inactive
and the vehicle was idling.
```
### 2.12 Advanced Inputs (Input Events)

```
The OBU can be configured to interface to a physical input. To remove the need to physically
interface to the OBU and to expand the type of inputs that can be supported by Connect , a set
of advanced input event endpoints have been created that allow input event data to be sent to
the Connect Application using the Advanced Inputs API.
```
```
An input event consists of:
```
```
● Asset identifier – the asset that the input event was generated against.
```
```
● Location – the latitude and longitude values where the input event occurred.
```
```
● Event type – that describes the overall event.
```
```
● Channel - that describes data for the event consisting of a number of input type key/value
pairs.
```

```
These are some example event and input types:
```
```
Event Type Input types
```
```
Vehicle Metrics Engine temperature
```
```
Tyre pressure
```
```
Oil Level
```
```
Refuse collection Bin Weight
```
```
Bin RFID tag
```
```
Photograph
```
```
Gully Cleaning Customer name
```
```
Work order
```
```
Time taken
```
```
Event Types and Input Types are loosely coupled. So, it is possible to use the “Oil Level” input for
both the “Vehicle Metrics” and “Gully Cleaning” events.
```

Input events added using the Advanced Inputs API are
```
```
● Shown in the Connect Web Application.
```
```
● Included in the response of Live Position and Live Position Latest.
