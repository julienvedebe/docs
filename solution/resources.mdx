my Connected Fleet is used to track and trace a resource. **my Connected Fleet Platform** receives location and related data from the asset via an **OBU**. The tracking data is viewable using the **my Connected Fleet Web Application** in either
tabular or on a map.

A resource can be:

- Vehicle – An asset (car, van, truck, trailer, boat, power generator etc.) which has an OBU installed.

  - A vehicle can be assigned to a group. The group assigned to a vehicle does not have to be the same group as assigned to a driver.

  - If a vehicle is part of the customer’s fleet (having a status of IN-CIRCULATION), its position is included in the response from Live Position.

  - If a vehicle is no longer part of the customer’s fleet (having a status of SOLD), the vehicle is not included in the response from Live Position but details of historical journeys can be retrieved

- Driver – A person that drives a vehicle. A driver can be associated with a key fob which enables Connect to determine who is driving a vehicle. A driver can be associated with a vehicle, e.g. their company car. A driver can be assigned to a group. The group for the driver does not have to be the same group as assigned to the vehicle.
