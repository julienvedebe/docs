title: "Speeding Episodes"
description: "Description of your new file."
---

The **Connect** application is able to determine if a vehicle is speeding and will create a **speeding episode** whenever both of the following conditions are satisfied.

- The vehicle speed exceeds the road speed limit for the vehicle type.
- At least two consecutive tracking frames are received where the vehicle speed exceeded the road speed limit for the vehicle type.

A speeding episode ends when any one of the following occurs:

- The vehicle’s speed drops below the road speed limit for the vehicle type.
- The speed limit for the road cannot be determined.
- The road type changes.

The road speed limit for a vehicle depends on the vehicle type. The following are UK examples of the road speed limits for different vehicle types.

| **Vehicle Type**                                                | **Single carriageways** | **Dual carriageways** | **Motorways**     |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------- |
| Cars, motorcycles, car-derived vans and dual-purpose vehicles.  | 60 mph (96 km/h)        | 70 mph (112 km/h)     | 70 mph (112 km/h) |
| Goods vehicles (not more than 7.5 tonnes maximum laden weight). | 50 mph (96 km/h)        | 60 mph (112 km/h)     | 70 mph (112 km/h) |

It is important that the vehicle type is set correctly as this will ensure the correct road speed limit is used.

1. **Alerts**

The **Connect application** can trigger an alert when specific conditions are met.  Alerts can be set for a single vehicle or vehicles in a group.

The available alert types are:
