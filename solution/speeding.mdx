title: "Speeding"
---

Speeding occurs when a vehicle is driven faster than the legal road speed limit for its vehicle type.
It is considered an undesirable *driving behaviour*, as it increases safety risks and contributes to higher fuel consumption, CO₂ emissions, and operating costs.

<Warning> Speeding may not be available in your geography. Please check local regulations or consult your Michelin Connected Fleet representative for regional availability. </Warning>


### Speeding Episodes
**myConnectedFleet** automatically detects when a vehicle exceeds the applicable road speed limit and records these as speeding episodes.

A speeding episode is created when both of the following conditions are met:
- The vehicle’s speed exceeds the road speed limit for its vehicle type.
- At least two consecutive tracking frames are received showing the vehicle above that limit.

A speeding episode ends when any of the following occur:
- The vehicle’s speed drops below the applicable speed limit.
- The road speed limit cannot be determined.
- The vehicle transitions to a different road type.


<Tip> Analysing speeding episodes by driver, vehicle, or location can help identify training needs or route specific risks. </Tip> 


<Note> Ensure that each vehicle’s **type classification** is set correctly in **myConnectedFleet**. This guarantees the appropriate road speed limits are applied when evaluating speeding behaviour. </Note>
