**MICHELIN Connected Fleet** can be used to monitor and to report on the activity of vehicles and drivers.  The solution comprises of:

- **myConnectedFleet portal **- used for reporting e.g accessing the track and trace functionality and managing assets/resources.
- **OBU** – is the OnBoard Unit (black box) telematics device installed in the vehicle/asset. The OBU typically transmits vehicle events such as ignition on, ignition off,  movement and  geographic position to the platform.
- **myConnectedFleet Platform** – this is the component that receives and processes the tracking events from an OnBoard Unit (OBU).
- **MICHELIN Connected Fleet API** - this is the Application Programming Interface that allows data to be pulled from myConnectedFleet.
