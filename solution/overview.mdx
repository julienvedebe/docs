## 2. MCF Solution

The MCF Connect solution comprises of:


- my Connected Fleet Platform – this is the component that receives and processes the tracking events from an OnBoard Unit (OBU).


- my Connected Fleet Web Application - this is the web based application used for managing assets/resources and accessing the track and trace functionality of Connect.


- OBU – is the tracking box installed on the vehicle/asset. The OBU typically transmits vehicle events such as ignition on, ignition off, resource movement and resource position to the platform.

- MICHELIN Connected Fleet API - this is the Application Programming Interface that allows data to be pulled from my Connected Fleet.






### 2.8 Driver Keys

A **driver key** is a way to identify who is driving a vehicle. A driver signs in with their key before
they begin a journey.

A driver can sign in using either:

```
● TachoID – the driver signs in using their Tachograph smart card.
```
```
● RFID – the driver touches their key fob against the MCF Light Bar.
```
```
● DALLAS – the driver touches their Dallas key fob against the MCF Light Bar.
```
A key can be configured so that all journeys using that key are specified as private journeys. A
private journey cannot be tracked or traced using the **Connect Web Application**.

A driver key (TachoID, RFID or DALLAS) can only be assigned to a single driver. Before you can
assign the key to another driver, the key must be first deleted from the donor driver.

### 2.9 Driver Behaviour

**Driver behaviour** provides an analysis of the driving behaviour based on the three key
performance indicators (KPI) which are based on the driving events that occur during a journey.
Driver behaviour analysis requires the driver to be either the default driver for a vehicle or the
driver signed in with their driver key during the journey.

The three key performance indicators (KPI) are:
● Smoother - This KPI shows how smoothly a vehicle was driven. It decreases when the driver brakes or accelerates harshly.

● Safer -This KPI shows how the percentage of distance travelled at safe speed. It decreases when the driver exceeds the road speed limit by more than 10%.

● Cleaner - This KPI shows the percentage of time spent driving compared to drive time + idling time. It decreases when more time is spent idling.


The aim for a driver is to achieve a value of 100% for each KPI.

● Changes in KPI values where the trend shows an increase in KPI value shows an
improvement in driving behaviour.

● Changes in KPI values where the trend shows a decrease in KPI value shows a deterioration in driving behaviour.

Due to the methodology used to calculate these KPI, the KPI can be used to compare the driving style across drivers in different groups, and organisations.


Note: Although either Driver Behaviour or EcoDrive can be used to analyse the driver’s driving behaviour, MCF’s current methodology is to use Driver Behaviour.


### 2.10 EcoDrive

The EcoDrive product allows analysis of a driver’s driving behaviour based on driving events that occur during a journey. EcoDrive analysis can be performed either for a vehicle or driver. Driver analysis requires the driver to be either the default driver for a vehicle or the driver signed in with their driver key during the journey.


The events that can be analysed are:
● Harsh braking
● Harsh acceleration
● Harsh cornering
● Over revving
● Excessive idling
● Speed over a defined threshold

Excessive idling can occur either inside or outside a specified set of POI location categories. For
example, if you set the location category for a number of POI locations to be “Goods Drop Point”,
you can then analyse the number of excessive idling that occurred within and outside these
“Goods Drop Point” POI locations.
```
```
Speed over a defined threshold event is generated whenever the vehicle’s speed exceeds the
value set for the ecoDrive speed threshold. The ecoDrive speed threshold is not checked
against the road speed limit and is not the same as a speeding episode.
```
```
The EcoDrive scoring algorithm uses these events to calculate a score per hour for a vehicle and
a driver. The target is to have a score of zero, i.e. there were no “bad” driving events during a
```

```
period being analysed. The calculated score can be used to rank the driving behaviour within a
group and compare the driving behaviour with all the other vehicles/drivers in the same group.
```
```
The EcoDrive scoring algorithm can be configured to give greater weight to one driving event
over the other events, for example, you can initially give greater weight to speeding, but as driver
behaviour changes, you can give greater weight to idling.
```
```
Please speak to your Customer Service Representative to find out more details about your
EcoDrive settings.
```
```
Note:
```
```
● Although either Driver Behaviour or EcoDrive can be used to analyse the driver’s driving
behaviour, MCF’s preferred methodology is to use Driver Behaviour.
```
### 2.11 Inputs and PTO

```
As well as detecting if the vehicle is moving, stopped or idling, the Masternaut OBU can be
configured to detect other vehicle activity, for example:
```
```
● if a door is opened or closed;
```
```
● the beacon lights are switched on or switched off;
```
```
● the street sweeper brushes are down or up.
```
```
This vehicle activity is reported in Connect Web Application as an input.
```
```
Power Take Off ( PTO ) is when the vehicle engine is being used to power additional machinery,
for example a crane. PTO uses additional fuel, therefore, it is important to know if the PTO was
active when the vehicle was moving, active when the vehicle was idling or if the PTO was inactive
and the vehicle was idling.
```
### 2.12 Advanced Inputs (Input Events)

```
The OBU can be configured to interface to a physical input. To remove the need to physically
interface to the OBU and to expand the type of inputs that can be supported by Connect , a set
of advanced input event endpoints have been created that allow input event data to be sent to
the Connect Application using the Advanced Inputs API.
```
```
An input event consists of:
```
```
● Asset identifier – the asset that the input event was generated against.
```
```
● Location – the latitude and longitude values where the input event occurred.
```
```
● Event type – that describes the overall event.
```
```
● Channel - that describes data for the event consisting of a number of input type key/value
pairs.
```

```
These are some example event and input types:
```
```
Event Type Input types
```
```
Vehicle Metrics Engine temperature
```
```
Tyre pressure
```
```
Oil Level
```
```
Refuse collection Bin Weight
```
```
Bin RFID tag
```
```
Photograph
```
```
Gully Cleaning Customer name
```
```
Work order
```
```
Time taken
```
```
Event Types and Input Types are loosely coupled. So, it is possible to use the “Oil Level” input for
both the “Vehicle Metrics” and “Gully Cleaning” events.
```
```
Input events added using the Advanced Inputs API are
```
```
● Shown in the Connect Web Application.
```
```
● Included in the response of Live Position and Live Position Latest.
```
### 2.13 Tax & Expense

```
The Tax & Expense product allows drivers to classify their journeys as business or private for tax
and business expense purposes. Once a journey has been classified it can be submitted to the
driver’s manager for approval.
```
```
The classifications for a journey are as follows:
```
```
● NOTSUBMITTED – the journey has not yet been submitted by the driver.
```
```
● BUSINESS – the journey was a business journey.
```
```
● PERSONAL – the journey was a personal journey.
```
```
● COMMUTE_A – a journey that was a commute to a normal place of work, this classification is
required in some European countries.
```
```
● COMMUTE_B – a journey that was a commute to a temporary place of work, this
classification is required in some European countries.
```

### 2.14 Connect Web User

```
A Connect web user has login credentials to access the Connect Web Application. The Connect
Web Application features that a user can access is dependent on the role they are assigned.
```
```
You can define the features that are available for each role and can create as many roles as
required to meet your reporting needs. A Connect Web user can be assigned to only one role.
```
```
A Connect Web user is allocated to a group in the group hierarchy. A user can only view details
(drivers, vehicles, journeys) for resources in the same group (or one of its subgroups) in the
group hierarchy.
```
```
When creating or updating a user, you can specify the timezone and language for the user with
the following values:
```
```
Attribute Definition
```
```
Timezone The timezone for the user. Dates and time are held in UTC and
converted into the specified timezone when displaying details in the
Connect Web Application.
```
```
Allowed timezone values are:
● Australia/Sydney
● Australia/Brisbane
● Australia/Adelaide
● Australia/Darwin
● Australia/Perth
● Atlantic/Azores
● Europe/Prague
● Europe/Berlin
● Europe/Copenhagen
● Europe/London
● Europe/Helsinki
● Europe/Paris
● Europe/Athens
● Europe/Rome
● Europe/Amsterdam
● Europe/Warsaw
● Europe/Lisbon
● Europe/Madrid
● Europe/Stockholm
● Africa/Luanda
● Africa/Casablanca
● Africa/Maputo
● America/New_York
● America/Chicago
● America/Denver
● America/Los_Angeles
● America/Anchorage
```

```
● America/Halifax
● America/Cayenne
● America/Guadeloupe
● America/Martinique
● Pacific/Honolulu
● Pacific/Midway
● Pacific/Noumea
● Pacific/Auckland
● Indian/Mayotte
● Indian/Reunion
```
Language The **Connect Web Application** provides multilingual support for the
following languages:
● English, English (US), French, Spanish, Swedish, German,
Czech, Danish, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Greek, Finnish and
Portuguese.

```
The language for the user is specified as one of the following
locales:
```
```
locale Language
```
```
en_GB English
```
```
en_US American English
```
```
fr_FR French
```
```
es_ES Spanish

```
pt_PT Portuguese
```
Unit of
measures

```
When a user is added to the Connect Web Application using the
Connect API , the unit of measures to use when viewing fuel
```

```
consumption, speed, fuel and distance are configured based on the
settings for the user’s customer account.
```
```
A user can update their settings using Connect Web Application.
```
```
You cannot specify the password for a Connect Web User in the same request as creating a new
Connect web user or when updating the details for an existing user. Instead, you set the
password by using the Set User Password endpoint and using either the token returned in the
JSON response from adding a new web user or the token returned in the JSON response from
calling the Password Reset Token endpoint.
```
```
This approach has been done as it allows you to either:
```
```
● Use the Set User Password endpoint to set the password.
```
```
● Send an email to the user so the user can use the Connect Web Application to set the
password.
```
```
The URL to include in the email to allow the user to use the Connect Web Application set
should be formatted as follows:
```
```
https://www.masternautconnect.com/Account/LogOn?customer=&token={token}#reset-passwor
d
```
```
Where {token} is the token returned in the JSON response from Add User or Password Reset
Token endpoints.
```
### 2.15 Single Sign On

```
The Connect Web Application supports Single Sign On (SSO) using the OpenID Connect
standard. SSO avoids the Connect Web User having to remember another username/password
combination as the user can access the Connect Web Application using their company’s
authentication details.
```
```
To enable SSO for a web user, you set an external identifier against the user.
```
```
● The external identifier is used to associate a user in your Authorization Server to a Connect
web user.
```
```
● The external identifier is returned by your Authorization Server once the user has been
successfully authenticated by your Authorization Server.
```
```
● A Connect Web User enabled for SSO cannot use the Connect Web Application functionality
to reset their password.
```
```
You can read more about OpenID Connect at https://openid.net/connect/.
```

### 2.16 Speeding Episodes

```
The Connect application is able to determine if a vehicle is speeding and will create a speeding
episode whenever both of the following conditions are satisfied.
```
```
● The vehicle speed exceeds the road speed limit for the vehicle type.
```
```
● At least two consecutive tracking frames are received where the vehicle speed exceeded the
road speed limit for the vehicle type.
```
```
A speeding episode ends when any one of the following occurs:
```
```
● The vehicle’s speed drops below the road speed limit for the vehicle type.
```
```
● The speed limit for the road cannot be determined.
```
```
● The road type changes.
```
```
The road speed limit for a vehicle depends on the vehicle type. The following are UK examples of
the road speed limits for different vehicle types.
```
```
Vehicle Type Single
carriageways
```
```
Dual
carriageways
```
```
Motorways
```
```
Cars, motorcycles,
car-derived vans and
dual-purpose vehicles.
```
```
60 mph (96 km/h) 70 mph (
km/h)
```
```
70 mph (
km/h)
```
```
Goods vehicles (not more
than 7.5 tonnes maximum
laden weight).
```
```
50 mph (96 km/h) 60 mph (
km/h)
```
```
70 mph (
km/h)
```
```
It is important that the vehicle type is set correctly as this will ensure the correct road speed limit
is used.
```
### 2.17 Alerts

```
The Connect application can trigger an alert when specific conditions are met. Alerts can be set
for a single vehicle or vehicles in a group.
```

The available alert types are:

```
