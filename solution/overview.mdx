The MCF Connect solution comprises of:


- my Connected Fleet Platform – this is the component that receives and processes the tracking events from an OnBoard Unit (OBU).


- my Connected Fleet Web Application - this is the web based application used for managing assets/resources and accessing the track and trace functionality of Connect.


- OBU – is the tracking box installed on the vehicle/asset. The OBU typically transmits vehicle events such as ignition on, ignition off, resource movement and resource position to the platform.

- MICHELIN Connected Fleet API - this is the Application Programming Interface that allows data to be pulled from my Connected Fleet.
