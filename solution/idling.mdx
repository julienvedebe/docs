title: 'Idling'
---

Idling is the running of a vehicle's engine when not in motion, and is generally seen as a negative behaviour that increases fuel consumption and emissions. Reducing idling has a positive effect on fuel consumption and emissions, and ultimately costs.  

By monitoring idling, **myConnectedFleet** can provide insight on both the duration of idling and where it geographically occured.  

myConnectedFleet calculates Idling from the OBU where a vehicles Ignition is “ON” and it is not moving for more than 2 minutes.  
 
Types of idling; 
- True engine idling: Idling triggered by engine running and non movement sensors e.g. RPM from CANbus.  
- Estimated Idling: Idling triggered by non movement and ignition on sensors (however not a guaranteed indication of engine running)
