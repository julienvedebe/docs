title: "Idling"
---

Idling refers to when a vehicle’s engine is running when the vehicle is stationary. It is generally considered an undesirable **driving behaviour** because it leads to unnecessary fuel consumption, CO₂ emissions, and operational costs.

By monitoring idling, **myConnectedFleet** provides insights into both the duration of idling events and the locations where they occur. This helps operators identify opportunities to improve driving efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

### Idling Calculation

**myConnectedFleet** determines idling based on data from the OBU using ignition and motion status.

An idling event is recorded when a vehicle’s ignition is ON but no movement is detected for more than 2 minutes.

### Types of Idling Detection

- **True Engine Idling**: Detected using engine running data (RPM from CANbus) combined with non-movement sensors. → Provides an accurate indication that the engine is running while stationary.
- **Estimated Idling**: Detected using ignition ON and non-movement status only. → May not guarantee the engine is running, but still provides useful behavioural insight where CANbus data is unavailable.

<Tip>
  Reviewing idling hotspots on journey and location reports helps identify recurring patterns, such as extended idling at depots or customer sites.
