title: "Single Sign On"
---

The **Connect Web Application** supports **Single Sign On** (SSO) using the **OpenID Connect** standard. **SSO** avoids the Connect Web User having to remember another username/password combination as the user can access the **Connect Web Application** using their company’s authentication details. 

To enable SSO for a web user, you set an **external identifier** against the user. 

- The external identifier is used to associate a user in your Authorization Server to a Connect web user.
- The external identifier is returned by your Authorization Server once the user has been successfully authenticated by your Authorization Server.
- A Connect Web User enabled for SSO cannot use the Connect Web Application functionality to reset their password.
