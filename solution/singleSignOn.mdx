title: "Single Sign On"
---

The **myCoonnectedFleet portal** supports **Single Sign On** (SSO) using the **OpenID Connect** standard.

**SSO** avoids the **myCoonnectedFleet** portal user having to remember another username/password combination as the user can access the **myCoonnectedFleet** portal using their company’s authentication details. 

To enable SSO for a user, set a value for the **external identifier** against the user. 

- The external identifier is used to associate a user in your Authorization Server to a user in the **myCoonnectedFleet portal**.
- The external identifier is returned by your Authorization Server once the user has been successfully authenticated by your Authorization Server.
- A **myCoonnectedFleet** portal user enabled for SSO cannot use the **myCoonnectedFleet portal** functionality to reset their password.
