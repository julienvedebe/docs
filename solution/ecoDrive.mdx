<Warning> EcoDrive is a legacy product </Warning>

**EcoDrive** product allows analysis of a driver’s driving behaviour based on driving events that occur during a journey. **EcoDrive** analysis can be performed either for a vehicle or driver. Driver analysis requires the driver to be either the default driver for a vehicle or the driver signed in with their driver key during the journey.

The events that can be analysed are:

- Harsh braking
- Harsh acceleration 
- Harsh cornering
- Over revving
- Excessive idling
- Speed over a defined threshold

**Excessive idling** can occur either inside or outside a specified set of POI location categories. For example, if you set the location category for a number of POI locations to be “Goods Drop Point”, you can then analyse the number of excessive idling that occurred within and outside these “Goods Drop Point” POI locations.

**Speed over a defined threshold** event is generated whenever the vehicle’s speed exceeds the value set for the **ecoDrive speed threshold**. The ecoDrive speed threshold is not checked against the road speed limit and is **<u>not</u>** the same as a speeding episode.

The **EcoDrive** scoring algorithm uses these events to calculate a score per hour for a vehicle and a driver. The target is to have a score of zero, i.e. there were no “bad” driving events during a period being analysed. The calculated score can be used to rank the driving behaviour within a group and compare the driving behaviour with all the other vehicles/drivers in the same group.

The **EcoDrive** scoring algorithm can be configured to give greater weight to one driving event over the other events, for example, you can initially give greater weight to speeding, but as driver behaviour changes, you can give greater weight to idling. 

Please speak to your **myConnectedFleet representative** to find out more details about your **EcoDrive** settings.

<Note>
  Although either **Driver Behaviour** or **EcoDrive** can be used to analyse the driver’s driving behaviour, MCF’s preferred methodology is to use **Driver Behaviour**.
