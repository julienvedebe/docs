<Warning> EcoDrive is a legacy driver performance product </Warning>

**EcoDrive** analyses a driver’s behaviour based on recorded driving events during a journey. Analysis can be performed per vehicle or per driver.

### Events
The events that can be analysed are:
- Harsh braking, Harsh acceleration and Harsh cornering
- Over revving (high RPM)
- Excessive idling
- Speed over a defined threshold


**Excessive idling** can occur either inside or outside a specified set of POI location categories e.g. outside of depots

**Speed over a defined threshold** event is generated whenever the vehicle’s speed exceeds the value set for the ecoDrive speed threshold. It is not compared against the road speed limit and is **<u>not</u>** the same as a speeding episode.


### Scoring Methodology
The EcoDrive scoring algorithm evaluates these events to calculate a score per hour for each vehicle or driver.  The target score is zero, meaning no undesirable driving events occurred during the analysis period.

Scores can be used to rank drivers or vehicles within a group and to compare performance across the fleet.

The scoring algorithm can be customised to assign different weights to specific driving events.  For example initially, you might assign greater weight to speeding events.  As driver performance improves, you might shift focus to idling or cornering.

For details about your organisation’s configuration, please contact your **MICHELIN** Connected Fleet representative.

<Note>
  Although either **Driver Behaviour** or **EcoDrive** can be used to analyse the driver’s driving behaviour, MCF’s preferred methodology is to use **Driver Behaviour**.
