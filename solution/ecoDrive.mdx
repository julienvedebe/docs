<Warning>
  EcoDrive is a legacy driver performance product. 
</Warning>

EcoDrive analyses a driver’s behaviour based on recorded driving events during a journey. Analysis can be performed per vehicle or per driver.

The events that can be analysed are:

- Harsh braking, Harsh acceleration and Harsh cornering.
- Over revving (high RPM).
- Excessive idling: either inside or outside POI location  categories e.g. outside of depots.
- Speed over a defined threshold: 
  - Note this is not a road speed limit breache, and is not the same as a speeding episode.

### Scoring Methodology

The algorithm evaluates recorded events to calculate a score per hour per vehicle or driver. Scores can be used to rank drivers or vehicles within a group and to compare performance across the fleet The target score is zero, meaning no undesirable driving events occurred during the analysis period.

Scoring can be customised to assign different weights to specific driving events.  For example, you might assign greater weight to speeding events.  As driver performance improves, you might shift focus to idling or braking.

<Note>
  Although either **Driver Behaviour** or **EcoDrive** can be used to analyse the driver’s driving behaviour, MCF’s preferred methodology is to use **Driver Behaviour**.
