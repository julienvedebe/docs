title: "Driver Behaviour"
---

**Driver behaviour** provides an analysis of the driving behaviour based on the three key performance indicators (KPI) which are based on the driving events that occur during a journey. Driver behaviour analysis requires the driver to be either the default driver for a vehicle or the driver signed in with their driver key during the journey.

The three key performance indicators (KPI) are:

**Smoother**
- This KPI measures how smoothly a vehicle was driven. It decreases when the driver brakes or accelerates harshly.

**Safe Speed**
- This KPI measures the percentage of distance travelled at safe speed. It decreases when the driver exceeds the road speed limit by more than 10%.

**Cleaner**
- This KPI measures the percentage of time spent driving compared to drive time + idling time. It decreases when more time is spent idling.


The aim for a driver is to achieve a value of 100% for each KPI.

- Changes in KPI values where the trend shows an <u>increase </u>in KPI value shows an improvement in driving behaviour. 
- Changes in KPI values where the trend shows a <u>decrease </u>in KPI value shows a deterioration in driving behaviour.

Due to the methodology used to calculate these KPI, the KPI can be used to compare the driving style across drivers in different groups, and organisations.


<Note> Although either **Driver Behaviour** or **EcoDrive** can be used to analyse the driver’s driving behaviour, MCF’s preferred methodology is to use **Driver Behaviour**.
