title: "Driver Behaviour"
---

Our **Driver behaviour** product provides analysis of the driving performance based on three key performance indicators (KPIs) which are derived from driving events recorded during each journey.

The three key performance indicators (KPI) are:

- **Smoother**: Measures how smoothly the vehicle is driven. The score decreases when the driver performs harsh braking or rapid acceleration events.
- **Safe Speed**: Measures the percentage of distance travelled within safe speed limits. The score decreases when the vehicle exceeds the road speed limit by more than 10%.
- **Cleaner**: Measures the percentage of driving time compared to driving + idling time.  The score decreases when the vehicle spends more time idling.

> 🎯 Goal: The ideal score for each KPI is 100%.

An increase in a KPI value indicates an improvement in driving behaviour.  A decrease in a KPI value indicates a deterioration in driving behaviour.

Because of the consistent methodology used, KPI scores can be compared across drivers, groups, and even organisations, allowing benchmarking of driving performance at scale.

<Note>
   Driver behaviour analysis requires the driver to be either the default driver for a vehicle or the driver signed in with their driver key during the journey.
