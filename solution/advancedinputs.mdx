## **Advanced Inputs (Input Events)**

The **OBU** can be configured to interface to a physical input. To remove the need to physically interface to the **OBU **and to expand the type of inputs that can be supported by **Connect**, a set of advanced input event endpoints have been created that allow input event data to be sent to the **myConnectedFleet Application** using the **Advanced Inputs API**.

Event Types and Input Types are loosely coupled. So, it is possible to use the “Oil Level” input for both the “Vehicle Metrics” and “Gully Cleaning” events.

Input events added using the **Advanced Inputs API** are

- Shown in the Connect Web Application.
- Included in the response of **Live Position** and **Live Position Latest**.
