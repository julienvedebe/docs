title: "Advanced inputs"
---

To remove the need to physically interface to the **OBU** and to expand the type of inputs that can be supported by **myConnectedFleet**, a set of advanced input event endpoints have been created that allow input event data to be sent to the \*\*myConnectedFleet platform \*\*using the **Advanced Inputs API**.

Event Types and Input Types are loosely coupled. So, it is possible to use the “Oil Level” input for both the “Vehicle Metrics” and “Gully Cleaning” events.

Input events added using the **Advanced Inputs API** are

- Shown in the **myConnectedFleet** portal.
- Included in the response of **Live Position** and **Live Position Latest**.

An input event consists of:

- **Asset identifier**: the asset that the input event was generated against.
- **Location**: the latitude and longitude values where the input event occurred.
- **Event type**: describes the overall event.
- **Channel**: describes data for the event consisting of a number of input type key/value


These are some event and input types as an example:

| Event Type         | Input types                                  |
| -------------------| ---------------------------------------------|
| Vehicle Metrics    | Engine temperature, Tyre pressure, Oil Level |
| Refuse collection  | Bin Weight, Bin RFID tag, Photograph         |
| Gully Cleaning     | Customer name, Work order, Time taken        |


Event Types and Input Types are loosely coupled. So, it is possible to use the “Oil Level” input for both the “Vehicle Metrics” and “Gully Cleaning” events.
