title: "Vehicles"

A vehicle is a tracked resource that represents any asset equipped with an On-Board Unit (OBU) telematics device. Vehicles can include cars, vans, trucks, trailers, tractors, and other motorised or towed assets.

- A vehicle can be assigned to a group for organisational or reporting purposes.
- When a vehicle is active in the customer’s fleet (status: IN-CIRCULATION), its latest position is returned in the Live Position API response.
- When a vehicle is no longer part of the customer’s fleet (status: SOLD), it is excluded from the Live Position response, but its historical journey data remains available for retrieval.

<Note>
  A vehicle’s group assignment does not need to match the group assigned to  the driver of the vehicle.
