- **BUSINESS **– the journey was a business journey.
- **PERSONAL **– the journey was a personal journey.
- **COMMUTE_A **– a journey that was a commute to a normal place of work, this classification is required in some European countries.
- **COMMUTE_B **– a journey that was a commute to a temporary place of work, this classification is required in some European countries.
