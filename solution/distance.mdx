title: "Distance travelled"
---

The distance that a vehicle travelled during a journey is captured by **myConnectedFleet** using one of two methods:

**CAN** 
- This is the most accurate method with the OBU extracting the distance travelled from the vehicle’s CANbus. Read more about CANbus at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus

**GPS**
- During a journey, the OBU calculates the distance between each GPS location and sums these distance values together to derive the total distance for the journey. 
- This method is not as accurate as the distance obtained from the CANbus.
