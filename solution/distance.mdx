## **Distance Travelled**

The distance that a vehicle travelled during a journey is captured by the OBU using one of two methods:

| **Method** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| CAN        | This is the most accurate method with the OBU extracting the distance travelled from the vehicleâ€™s CANbus.<br /><br />You can read more about CANbus at [<u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus</u>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus)           |
| GPS        | During a journey, the OBU calculates the distance between each GPS location and sums these distance values together to derive the total distance for the journey.<br /><br />This method is not as accurate as the distance obtained from the CANbus. |
