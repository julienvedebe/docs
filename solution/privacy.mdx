title: "Private journeys"
---

A driver can specify a journey to be **private**.

A **private journey** cannot be viewed using the **myConnectedFleet** portal. 

Likewise, the **API** does not return any tracking or tracing information for a private journey. 

However, the distance travelled and the fuel used in a private journey are taken into account when calculating utilisation and fuel summary details for a vehicle.
