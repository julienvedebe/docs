A private journey is a journey that a driver has specified as **private**. A **private journey** cannot be tracked or traced using the **Connect Web Application**. Likewise, the **Connect API** does not return any tracking or tracing information for a private journey. However, the distance travelled and the fuel used in a private journey are taken into account when calculating utilisation and fuel summary details.
